                        <p>A picturesque grazing land for Ishigaki Gyu (Ishigaki Island Wagyu beef), and serving as a perfect hub for other neighbouring Yaeyama islands, Ishigaki Island (also known as Ishigaki-jima) offers pleasant beaches, colorful coral reefs, beautiful jungle and lush mangrove rivers, making it an easy getaway without giving up the conveniences of modernity. If you like jungles as well as beaches, we highly recommend the Yaeyama Island group. The Yaeyama Islands are also perfect for snorkeling and scuba diving as they have one of the largest coral reef systems in Asia.</p>

                        <p>Morning greetings from local sea turtles, and numerous secret beaches which will take your breath away. Zamami is a small and hilly island packed full of natural and easily-accessible beauty. Zamami’s most famous beach, Furuzamami Beach is popular for snorkeling with beautiful coral and many different kinds of tropical fish, it has more than a few idyllic wild beaches which we highly encourage you to check out. Around Zamami, there are several idyllic deserted islands (we’d recommend Gahi Island) which are great for a half-day or day-trip by taxi boat.</p>

                        <p>Yakushima Island is listed as a UNESCO World Natural Heritage site and it is for true nature explorers. Yakushima is mostly famous for hiking through pristine mossy rainforests, however it also boasts beautiful beaches (and has one of the world’s most important nesting grounds for the endangered loggerhead turtle), great seafood, and is easily accessible from Kagoshima. As Yakushima is one giant granite monolith with the highest point being almost 2000 meters, it is very interesting to explore the different elevations, each with its own climate, unique vegetation and wildlife.</p>

                        <p>A large island, similar in size to Okinawa main island, Amami Oshima has a completely different feeling due to the sparseness of the population. The island is not a tourist hub, but is great for people who want to do a road trip, exploring the countless untouched beaches, driving on winding roads through rainforests and discovering Amami culture.Due to the size of the island, it is good to concentrate a stay on a specific part of the island. There are many amazing beaches on Amami Oshima, and depending on the wind direction, you can be sure to find one which is perfect for the day.</p>
